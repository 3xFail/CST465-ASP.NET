        <p>Really, you're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilisation. Your people have a holiday named ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school. You know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? Holy crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty, run! I-I've never seen that thing before in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is! We-we gotta get out of here, Morty, it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die, Morty! We're gonna die! Wow I really crononberg'd up the whole place huh Morty, just a bunch a cronenbergs walkin around.

Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man. Please god, oh lord, hear my prayers…! YES! Fuck you god, not today bitch! I don't know man, Italy, Greece, Argentina... Yo! What up my glip glops!</p>

        <p>You can run, but you can't hide bitch! Where are my testicles, Summer? You ask alotta questions Morty, not very charismatic of you. Sometimes science is a lot more art, than science. A lot of people don't get that.

The fucking amish bitch shot me! Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick! I do not have discolored butthole flaps. Hello Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?</p>
